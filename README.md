This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) coding challenge built for Paige by Matthew Greci.

My overall thought process was to first ensure functionality of the given requirements, second refactor source code to increase readability, and third try to build a somewhat good looking UI. 

Couple different places that could be optimized (the way the context obtains the product list, further TypeScript utilization, TESTS!) but I choose to not spend more than about 3 total hours on the entire challenge so I had to focus on the primary goals first.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
